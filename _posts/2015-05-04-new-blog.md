I have completed the migration of this blog to my <a href="http://www.zsoltnagy.eu" target="_blank">private website</a>, including a <a href="http://www.zsoltnagy.eu/know-your-learning-style/" target="_blank">new article</a>.

The decision behind this move is self-explanatory: I wanted to combine the simplicity of publishing a Jekyll-Now post with a solution that scales. At the time of writing this post, <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all" target="_blank">23.8% of all websites on the web use Wordpress</a>. Given the massive popularity of the platform, a huge number of reliable plugins are available for making the blog better, faster and more SEO-friendly. In addition, thanks to the Markdown support added by the Jetpack Wordpress plugin, I managed to migrate the content powering this blog 99.9% unchanged. I only had to change some hard coded absolute URLs, and in the process, proof-reading the articles once revealed some small errors that I corrected as well.

When I started writing this blog, most of the content was targeted for learning and experimentation. Some of the posts were converted into PDF and used as tutorials and examples in class. I added Google Analytics support to the site about a month ago and saw that a post got about 300 to 600 views, while readers spent 2 to 4 minutes on a page in average. 

Meanwhile, I realized that I have an own domain with an old, mostly outdated website, containing at least 2 years old information on me. Therefore, I spent last week on setting the Wordpress site up, migrating content, installing the right plugins and making sure that Google won't penalize me for duplicated content (hint: see the Canonical link in the `head` of all my posts to the corresponding post in <a href="http://www.zsoltnagy.eu" target="_blank">zsoltnagy.eu</a>). Currently, only my blog is online. In the near future, I will update the content of my old website and create other pages on the site that are of either entertaining or informative nature. You can also expect continuous improvements on the site, and at least one post per week. 

Long story short, if you subscribed to this blog via RSS, you won't receive any more updates here. I suggest subscribing to <a href="http://www.zsoltnagy.eu/feed/" target="_blank">the RSS feed of zsoltnagy.eu</a> instead. If you have any feedback to the new format, please let me know.
